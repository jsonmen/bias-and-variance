# Churn Prediction
**Abstract**  
In this notebook, I explore and model customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. First, I implement a reproducible preprocessing pipeline (encoding categorical features). I then conduct exploratory data analysis to identify key churn drivers. Next, I compare several classification approaches—Logistic Regression (with and without class weighting), Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost—both without oversampling and with SMOTE, tuning hyperparameters via randomized search. My best result (F1 ≈ 0.66, ROC-AUC ≈ 0.77, recall ≈ 0.80) comes from a manually tuned Logistic Regression. Finally, I perform survival analysis: I fit and analyze a Cox Proportional Hazards model to estimate churn risk over time, and build an interactive ipywidgets dashboard that displays personalized survival functions, expected remaining tenure, and future churn probabilities for any given customer.
